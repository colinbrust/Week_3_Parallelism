I would assume that this is because the overhead of spinning up multiple Python interpreters to solve this relatively simple optimization problem doesn't outweigh the benefit of using multiple threads.\n",

As a result, when we take np.mean across all parallel batches, we are getting extremely small parameter updates. If you change np.mean to np.sum, the accuracy increases at a rate comparable to vanilla gradient descent on a single thread because the parameter update step size is actually much larger. In this scenario, our parameter updates are very specific to each inidividual parallel_batch, meaning information about the gradient is not general to the optimization problem as a whole. This leads to a much longer convergence time when the parallel_batch size is very large.\n",

    "4) If we were using data parallelism, the entire neural network would be set up on each processor. This means that each processor would be able to run forward and backward steps using only x (inputs) and y (targets). However, in order to compute the true gradient of the dataset, all gradients would need to be shared across processors so that gradient descent steps could be in the correct direction. This could either be done by sharing all parameters on a parameter server or by implementing an allreduce function across all processors. \n",
    "\n",
    "5) Within the feedforward and backpropagate functions, we would need to split up all of the matrix multiplication steps into multiple matrix multiplications of size 'parallel_batches'. This would require appropriate splitting up of all matrices so that when the outputs were aggregated, they yielded the same result as a single matrix multiplication. This would require careful separation of inputs so that parallelized matrix multiplication was exactly identical to a single matrix multiplication. \n",
    "\n",
    "6) To implement pipeline paralellism, we would need to break up the forward and backpropagate functions so that each matrix multiplication operation (I'm negelecting the other operations because they are all elementwise and have lower computational cost) was performed by different processors. In theory, this would be much easier to implement than model parallelism because it wouldn't require any additional math to split up the matrix multiplication operations. You could just pass the output of one processor as the input to the next processor. \n",
    "\n",
    "7) If the output of a given layer in the pipeline had, for example, 10 million weights associated with it, sharing these weights between processors would take up a lot of memory and read/write time. If we used data quantization to aggregate weights that had more or less the same values, we could significantly reduce the size of the dataset that needed to be transferred between processors. This would likely improve performance in the distributed environment. "
